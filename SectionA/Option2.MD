## Naming conventions

Line 1: Good job naming the file "recursion.java". It is clear and descriptive.

Lines 3-8: It is good that you have included comments to explain what the code is doing. This makes it easier for someone else to read and understand your code.

Line 1: Naming conventions: The class name recursion should follow Java naming conventions, which suggests using PascalCase. So it should be renamed to Recursion with the first letter capitalized.

## Code implementation

Lines 10-13: You correctly initialize the string that will be reversed.

Lines 15-21: The reverse_string() method is implemented correctly using recursion to reverse a string. Nice job!

## `function()` method

Lines 23-37: The function() method is intended to print out the first n Fibonacci numbers. However, there are a few issues with this method that need to be addressed. First, the method signature is incorrect, as you have both a parameter named maxNumber and a type parameter named T. Secondly, the value of maxNumber is hard-coded to 10, which means that the function will always print out the first 10 Fibonacci numbers regardless of the input parameter. Finally, the method does not actually get called in the main method, so it doesn't do anything at all. I recommend fixing these issues so that the function() method can work properly.

Overall, your code shows good use of comments and an understanding of recursion. Keep up the good work and keep practicing!
