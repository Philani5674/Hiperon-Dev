#What is your developer experience?


`As a recent graduate who made the decision to pursue software development in 2019, I have come a long way in my journey as a developer. At first, I was intimidated by the field, but I persevered and learned new programming concepts in languages like C#, Python, and Java. Along the way, I discovered the importance of testing and code review, both of which have become central to my development process. I have worked with numerous frameworks, APIs, and code editors, and I was even introduced to Linux, which posed a significant challenge as I learned to work with the terminal. Despite these challenges, I remain passionate about software development and am continually learning from the industry.`


#What is your experience as an educator?


`I don't have any formal experience as an educator, but I have engaged in peer-to-peer learning activities that have taught me to share my solutions and provide constructive feedback on others' code. Through these experiences, I've developed my communication, collaboration, and mentoring skills. Although I haven't taught in a formal classroom setting, I feel confident in my ability to work with others and help them learn.`

#Working remotely, how do you deal with power and connectivity outages? Do you have a backup system?

`As a remote worker in South Africa, I've found that dealing with power outages caused by load shedding can be challenging. However, I've learned to cope with this challenge by making sure I have a load shedding schedule and keeping my devices fully charged during those hours. I also have mobile data on standby in case I lose connectivity due to power outages. This way, I can continue working efficiently despite the power disruptions.`
